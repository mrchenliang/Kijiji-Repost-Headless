postAdForm.title: National PPE Text Prep Questions (300 Q&A and key knowledge)
postAdForm.description: 'If you are planning on writing the National Professional Practice Exam (NPPE) to eventually obtain your professional engineering license, these notes and practice exams will prepare you for the exam and pass it easily!

Helped myself get through the test very easily and smoothly. All I did was the practice exams and go through the key knowledge.
The test is 3 hours in duration, and has 110 questions. 
The syllabus can be found here: https://www.peo.on.ca/sites/default/files/2020-06/NPPE-Syllabus.pdf
Roughly took 20 hours to review to pass the NPPE'
